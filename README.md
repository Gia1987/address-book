## Address book

Please create a React and Typescript app with a page that allows users to select an address from an address book.

If the address book is empty, the user should be able to lookup address by postcode or enter address manually.
The user should be able to switch between 2 modes (lookup or manual entry).
Once the address is selected or manually entered, it should be saved to the address book.
When searching for address by postcode, the user should be presented with results and be able to select an address.
The address should include line1-3, postcode, town and country.

When entering the address manually, line1, postcode, town and country are mandatory fields.
Country should be a combobox with autosuggestion from a drop down list.
When searching by postcode, use [https://getaddress.io/](https://getaddress.io/) API (sign up with an email to get free trial).
You should handle different error cases and display relevant error messages, e.g. wrong postcode.
The style should match Bequest's branding as closely as you can replicate.
